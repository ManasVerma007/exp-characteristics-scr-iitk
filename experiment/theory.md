<h2>a) Definition of V-I Characteristics of SCR: -</h2>
A V-I Characteristic of SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) is the voltage current characteristics.<br> The current through the SCR varies as the Anode to Cathode terminal <br>voltage and Gate to Cathode terminal voltage is varied. <br>The graphical representation of current through the SCR and voltage across the anode to <br>cathode terminal is known as V-I Characteristics of SCR.
<h2>b) Circuit Diagram for Obtaining V-I Characteristics of SCR: -</h2>
To obtain V-I characteristics of SCR, its anode and cathode are connected to the source through the load.<br> The Gate and cathode are fed through a separate source <br>which is meant to provide positive gate current from gate to cathode.<br> The elementary circuit diagram for obtaining V-I characteristics of SCR is shown below.<br>
In the above diagram, Anode and Cathode terminals A & K are connected to variable<br> voltage source E through Load and Gate terminal G is connected to the source Es to <br>provide positive gate current through G to K when switch S is closed.<br> Va and Ia represent the voltage across the anode to cathode terminals and current through the SCR. <br>A plot between Va and Ia is drawn by varying the source voltage E and noting the corresponding current through SCR.<br> This plot gives the V-I characteristics of SCR.
